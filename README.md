# What is it?

This is C & x86_64 asembly hybrid script that creates bmp image of a gradient triangle using given apexes and their colors.

# How to use 

Just change hardcoded apexes in C file and run it.


Note
I don't recommend trying it on amd ryzen 5 processor because it doesn't seem to work (registers behaved improperly), while on intel it was ok
